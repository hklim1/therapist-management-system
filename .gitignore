# ===================================================
# ________________PURPOSE OF FOLDERS_________________

# hand-therapy(venv): keeps the versions/libraries that our application is relying on. All of that is done thru pip installs. (leave alone)
# migrations: kind of like the git folder. a version control system for our database (leave alone)
# app:
#      init file: "the brains of the folder". has some built in functionality, where anytime youre importing from a folder it will run thru ur init file. this is where we instantiate all of our libraries. we're depending on or connecting them to our application.
# handbook.py: entry point to our application. it imports from app, so that's where we get access to all of our third party libraries, connect to blueprints, get routes and models we've been creating.
# resources: what our server is serving- the data we are sending, receiving, & storing. we need to query our db if we want info about our users- so resources is where the magic happens.
#   resources __init__: makes a blueprint to section all the code into a user section, mostly for organization, helps connects to routes
#   resources routes: how we make all our endpoints. adds endpoints to our API, endpoints run the associated "now" method thats going to interact with our db (e.g. everything we see in insomnia)
#   UserModel: specific to SQLAlchemy which is our ORM. allows us to interact w/ SQL db from our python env. Has a class (our db model), which is how we create a SQL alchemy table. Each class has attributes that will become the names of our columns - specifies data type & constraints. Also have associated utility methods - reusable code for when we're interacting w/ db (e.g. first creating user, storing user pw, checking pw)
# gitignore - files we odnt want to send to github. might have things like sensitive info.
# ===================================================
# hand-therapy/ = the venv

# flask-migrate is like a version control tool for sqlalchemy. its like a git for sql alchemy.

# if you don't know which pip installs you need to do, copy his requirements.txt and then put "pip install -r requirements.txt"

# can run "flask shell" in terminal
# if you do then you need to do "pip install psycopg2-binary", then pip freeze > requirements.txt
# flask shell - its like a python env but using specific flask stuff. it's a way to practice syntax in terminal & early debugging.
# Try the following in the temrinal after running flask shell
# >>> from resources.users.UserModel import UserModel
# >>> u = UserModel() which makes an instance of UserModel()
# >>> according to usermodel() we need at least username, email, pw
# >>>u.username = 'dylans'
# >>>u.email = 'ds@ct.com'
# >>>u.password_hash = '213'
# >>>db.session.add(u)
# >>>db.session.commit()
# that should commit "u" into our database, so when you then type
# >>>u.username, it will give 'dylans'
# we get cool functionality when using DB models as far as PK/FK relationships. We'll be able to connect all instances of our users.
# >>>from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
# >>>hashed = generate_password_hash('123')
# returns: a very intersting, long, convoluted string of alphanumeric characters AKA the hashed pw
# >>>check_password_hash(hashed, '123')
# returns True if the second argument  (user's actual pw, not the hashed version) is correct, false if otherwise

# THE IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS TO RUN IN TERMINAL TO UPLOAD YOUR WORK INTO THE ELEPHANTSQL DATABASE
# flask db init (keep in mind the "db" is going to be whatever variable you make equal to SQLAlchemy(app) in the app __init__ file) (also you only run this command once, just like a git init)
# flask db migrate -m "first migrate" (this is the staging portion, it's kinda the staging and pushing portion"
# If after you migrate you see something like "Detected added table 'users'" - this is usually a good sign that your migration succeeded
# flask db upgrade (this is the actual commit push portion)
# YAY! Now check your elephantsql>browsre>table queries to make sure it all pushed thru. In the text box above that button you can type normal functions just like in SQL e.g. "SELECT * from "public"."users" LIMIT 100

# now we can run flask shell again
# >>>db
# >>> u = UserModel(username='seanc', email='seanc@ct.com')
# u.hash_password('123') # this is using the method in our PatientModel() to generate hashed pw
# print(u.password_hash) (checks to make sure it got stored)
# db.session.add(u)
# db.session.commit()
# woohoo it worked in the video

# flask shell is just to test

# ================================== ACCESS TOKENS ==========================================
# INSTALLS
# ==============================
# pip install flask-jwt-extended
# --Used to help with access tokens

# pip install gunicorn
# --Used to host server?

# TO GET SECRETS KEY, RUN THE FOLLOWING IN TERMINAL:
# >>> python
# >>> from secrets import SystemRandom
# >>> SystemRandom.getrandbits(128)
# also check into random library instead of secrets - check urlsafe function

# TO HAVE LOGIN ACCESS TOKENS AUTOMATICALLY RENEW IN INSOMNIA:
# Header >> Authorization
# Type Bearer and Select "Response = Body Attribute"
# CHANGE THE FOLLOWING TO:
# Request: [Auth Patient] POST LOGIN /login
# Filter: $.access_token
# Trigger behavior: When Expired
# Max age: 300 seconds
# YOU CAN ALSO DO THIS IN BASE ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE SET THE URL. Same process except it'll be a key-value pair: "access_token":"Response = Body Attribute"

# -handles storing login sessions
# -client (front end built on top of the server) handles user interface: asking to register, info the login and start, etc. without access token, nothing stops users from just being like "im user 5 and im gonna make a post about how i hate america". Need to authenticate who they are first. So we have client ask for username/pw then the user will hit our server: as long as its valid username & pw they are logged in, but important that we preserve that state on our server so later when they hit other points where they need to be logged in, the client knows that the user is still logged in and authenticated. If it's valid, we send them back an encoded access token with things like user id. Access tokens are safer and more secure than just repeatedly requesting the authetntication information. 

# WHEN SETTING UP TO HOST YOUR DATABASE:
# pip install gunicorn
# pip freeze > requirements.txt
# UPDATE YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY. Will pull off a specific branch (usually the main one)
